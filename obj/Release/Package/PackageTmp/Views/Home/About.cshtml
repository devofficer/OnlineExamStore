                WWW.ACADASTORE.COM is a website adapted to function on computers and mobile phones. We provide online test questions and answers for students in JSS 1 – SS 3 in at least 10 subjects in electronic format, automated to run as Computer Based Tests (CBT). Each subject onsite aims to cover questions in all the topics for that class (JSS 1 – SSS 3). 
                <br />
                We also provide past questions for the various categories of examinations in Nigeria as JAMB, WAEC and Junior NECO.
                <br /><br />
                Our question database is arranged topically. Users can therefore focus on areas/subjects/topics of interest only. Depending on the topic(s) indicated at the creation of a CBT, questions are generated based on those parameters/selections. Registered users can login to the site, attempt CBT’s, submit them and view their results, with explanations provided where necessary and keep record of all the tests attempted all year round. Parents and teachers can gainfully keep students occupied and exposed to test materials. With Acadastore, a parent can easily set tests and actively monitor his child’s academic activities and progress on a daily basis or remotely through any internet enabled device whether from his office or anywhere in the world on the go.
